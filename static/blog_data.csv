Italian Alfredo Maggi,Moumita Saha,2023-01-14 20:16:23.508642,Food,"<p>So first up is my version of an Italian Maggi. Not all of these versions use the Maggi Tastemaker because sometimes we just don&#39;t need it (read: sometimes we use two Tastemaker packets for one cake of Maggi cause we like with extra masala), irrespective of how awesome it is. I use everyday ingredients like all purpose flour, butter and milk to make this my own version of Alfredo Maggi. This one uses mushrooms and olives but go ahead, make this your own! Add some chicken to your Maggi and make it Italian Chicken Maggi or some broccoli. Or do this in store bought red pasta sauce instead of white. Every way possible, Maggi still tastes great!</p>
